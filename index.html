index.html

This is the  main index.html page for the web app.

It was inspired by the emoji scavenger hunt google project and teachable machine(see CREDITS below).
The emoji savenger hunt however was written in typscript. I modified the code so it
could run with raw/vanilla javascript. (Thank you  to the dev team of the
emoji scavenger hunt for ansering all my questions regarding their app). Instead of
creating a UX/UI for a game to detect emojis(like in the original), the current frontEnd 
is used to scan images and then takes you to a google image search to cross reference the image
found. 


Update as of December 2022:
I liked teachable machine a lot but I couldn't train AI right on my phone.
I decided to add this is a new feature to the web app (to apply what I learned from the edx course
of Jason Mayes).
The web app can now
1)Train custom AI models righ on the User's phone,
2)Save and export those models for sharing on sites like glitch or github
3)Use those models for the main C-RISE (customizable reverse image search engine)
4)the web app can still load AI models trianed on the teachable machine website and shared
using teachable machine URL's.



Updated as of April 2022:
I've also taken recent inspiration from the teachable machine (see links  below)
which allows anyone to train their own AI models in the cloud. The updated version 
uses the teachable machines libarary to more easily load AI/ML models using
tensorflow.js.

Updated as of 11/27/2019:
using the teachable machine API
https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachablemachine-community/tree/master/libraries/image
Will now use tmImage module to handle the video capture and model predict functions

            <li>
                <h2>About the WebApp</h2>

                <p>This is a web app I'm developing that uses AI/Machine learning in the browser that tries to predict
                    or infer
                    what it sees in an image using your computer's, tablet's or phone's camera. It uses tensorflow.js
                    and
                    runs completely on your local machine and in the browser. No image data is uploaded to any server
                    to protect privacy.</p>

                <p> This web app runs an AI/ML algorithm completely in the browser and can use graphics acceleration for
                    faster inference and prediction.</p>

                <p> It uses the camera (On phone or desktop) to scan images and tries to recognize images
                    (not certified for professional or medical use and is simply a proof of concept). No images or video
                    are
                    uploaded to any cloud server. All computations are processed directly on your machine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have your own pretrained custom model using <a
                        href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/"
                        style="font-weight: bold; font-size:larger">Teachable Machine</a>,
                    you can copy and then paste the link to your model in the form box at the lower left hand corner of
                    the main app (upper most window of the app).
                </p>

                <p>Currently known to run on: The latest firefox, opera and chrome on desktop/laptop, and mobile
                    (android).
                    Hardware
                    limitations may limit the speed of the prediction or drain phone batteries quickly as AI/ML may
                    prove demanding
                    on certain types of hardware. The current version's initial loading time can reach less than 5-15
                    seconds
                    depending on the internet speed (this is even faster than the older loading times of 10-20 seconds)
                    as
                    the AI/ML model is deployed. Subsequent reloads will be faster as the model is cached (unless the
                    browser is closed and restarted).

                <h2>Camera Scanner</h2>
                <p>Press the round button on the lower right of the main window app to start scanning.</p>
                <p>Focus the camera on an image.</p>
                <p>Real time predictions and their respective probabilites are on the upper left.</p>

                <p>Final prediction will be at the bottom bar revealing a link to a google image search</p>
                <p>To hide real time predictions, differentials and their probabilities...press the button below

                <h2>NEW FEATURE: Train your own AI model with your phone</h2>
                <p>I really like teachable machine's ability to train models with javascript
                    but I wanted to add this functionality to my phone (so I won't have to get laptop
                    or a large desktop to train models). The new section for
                    "Train Your Own Model, Save, and Export it here" now let's you point your mobile phone's
                    camera and gather image data on the fly. You can add as many classes as your hardware supports
                    (AI models can be very demanding of processing power and memory). You can save and export the
                    newly trained model and share the model on services like glitch or github.

            <li>
                <p>I tried my hand at an AI/ML project so that I might hopefully encourage my fellow radiologists
                    in my country or anywhere in the world to more actively participate in the growth and development
                    of AI/ML for radiology. I hope to prove to them that the technology is not beyond their reach
                    especially with amazing libraries like tensorflow which have made it easier and more approachable
                    for professionals like myself to explore the amazing world and possible applications of AI/ML in
                    my domain of expertise.

                <p>Would a DICOM scanner be intersting?</p>
                <p>This is currently a "proof of concept" (powered by tensorflow and tensorflow.js) to help inform and
                    spread the word
                    on the possibilities of AI/ML applications in medicine and radiology. If you have suggestions or
                    want to

                <p>A web app for <b>DEPLOYING</b> and <b>TRAINING</b> AI computer vision models with
                    little or NO CODE right on your phone. <br>

                </p>

            </div>


            <div id="subtitle0" class="subtitle">

            </div>


            <p>
                The web app acts as a <i><b>Customizable Reverse Image Search Engine (CRISE)</b></i>. It will try to
                classify what
                it sees using your computer, tablet, or phone's web cam and then produce a hyperlink
                at the bottom that will take you to a google image search page showing you other images
                that may match what the camera is currently looking at. Apps with similar reverse image search
                functionality already exist such as
                <a href="https://lens.google/" style="font-weight: bold; font-size:larger"> google lens</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this web app allows the users to train their own custom AI/ML
                model right on their <b style="color:rgb(208, 255, 0)">PHONE</b> or load
                models they pretrained on <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/"
                    style="font-weight: bold; font-size:larger">Teachable Machine</a></p>





            <p>
                This allows users to create custom reverse image search engines (personal C-RISE) for specific use
                cases.
                (Please scroll down and read to accept the terms of use and begin.)
            </p>
            <p>Initial load may takes 5-10 seconds (on slow connections). Press the
                lower right button to start scanning. Focus camera on an image you
                want to analyze. Real time predictions are on the upper left. Final prediction
                will be at the bottom (as a hyperlink to google image search).

                    <p>
                        Click the camera icon and focus your camera on a
                        scene or image you want to analyze. Try to focus on a specific part and see how the AI
                        algorithm
                        tries to guess what it is.</p> </br>

                    <p>If you have your own custom model hosted on teachable machine's servers, you can copy and paste
                        the link to your model in the form box (see picture below) and replace the <b>./my_model/.</b>
                        Clicking on the image will also take you to the location of the form box. </p> </br>

                    <p> The box to the right of the <b>./my_model/</b>
                        represent the threshold value used by the AI model. Think of "threshold" as
                        the level of "sureness" an AI has regarding its prediction.

                        This is set to "any" by default meaning the AI will keep guessing indefinitely
                        until you press the camera icon again to make it stop.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you set the threshold value to a number between from 0.01 to 1.0,
                        the AI will stop scanning when it reaches threshold value or level of
                        "sureness" for a particular prediction.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When AI/ML models try to classify
                        images they produce probability scores (of how "sure" the AI is about its prediction for the
                        image).
                        When one of the predicted classes reaches a threshold score, the model will stop
                        predicting and use this to make a google image search.
                        You can try setting this initially to 0.9 (or 90%) but you experiment
                        with other values. </p> </br>


                    <p>You also don't have to wait for the model to reach a specific score for it to stop.
                        You can chose to manualy click or touch the camera button to make the AI model stop scanning.
                        The predicted
                        class with the most recent highest score will then be used to make a google image search.

                    <p> When you've decided what URL to use for the new model and the thershold value you want to use
                        (or
                        just keep the default value of "any"), you can press enter or click the submit button.

                    <p>Once you've collected enought data (try 100 frames each or more), click the
                        "Train and Predict!" Button. The AI model will start to analyze and use machine learning
                        to distinguish between the 3 classes of images ("cat", "dog" , and "robot"). When the training
                        is complete,
                        you can aim your camera at new images and see how well your AI model can predict
                        "Cat vs Dog vs robot."

                        Your browser will download 3 types of files:

                            <li>shards files</li>
                            <li>model.json file</li>
                            <li>metadata.json file (this contains the labels for your model)</li>
                        </ol>

                        You can put these files in a folder for later use or upload and share/serve them
                        on either

                        <ol>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> or</li>
                            <li><a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a></li>
                        </ol>


                    </p>

                    <p>Once served on glitch or github, you can access any of your pretrained models via inputting
                        the URL link in the main window app above. The main app will use your new model and new
                        labels for images it was trained on. (Remember that the main web app
                        at the top most portion of the web page also accepts URL links for
                        models trained on <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/"
                            style="font-weight: bold; font-size:medium">Teachable Machine</a>.)

                    <p>If you want to reset everything (revert back to just two classes
                        and prepare the model for retraining), just click or tap on the
                        "Reset" Button.
